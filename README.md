SpringBoot PCF config server


Instead of having properties or yml in each springboot application jar, it will be good if we have remote configurations for our applications and then spring boot application access those.

PCF Configuration of Config Server service
While using PCF there is no need to develop separate spring cloude config server springboot application rather we will use the PCF inbuilt Config Server service.
